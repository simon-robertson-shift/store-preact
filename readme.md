# reactive-preact

A sensible and faster alternative to Redux for JavaScript and TypeScript application state management in the frontend.

This package extends [store](https://github.com/simon-robertson-shift/store) to provide a helpful Preact hook for monitoring state changes within a component. See the demonstration below.

For now, take a look at [store-react-demo](https://github.com/simon-robertson-shift/store-react-demo) for a working NextJS demonstration of the React version, the usage is exactly the same.

### installation

`npm i @nememo/store-preact`
